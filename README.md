***SHORT SUMMARY***
<p align="justify"> The film is about a young man with the ability to time travel who tries to change his past in hopes of improving his future. At the age of 21, Tim Lake (Domhnall Gleeson) discovers he can travel in time. The night after another unsatisfactory New Year party, Tim's father (Bill Nighy) tells his son that the men in his family have always had the ability to travel through time. Tim can't change history, but he can change what happens and has happened in his own life-so he decides to make his world a better place by getting a girlfriend. Sadly, that turns out not to be as easy as you might think. Moving from the Cornwall coast to London to train as a lawyer, Tim finally meets the beautiful but insecure Mary (Rachel McAdams). They fall in love, then an unfortunate time-travel incident means he's never met her at all. So they meet for the first time again-and again-but finally, after a lot of cunning time-traveling, he wins her heart. Tim then uses his power to create the perfect romantic proposal, to save his wedding from the worst best-man speeches, to save his best friend from professional disaster and to get his pregnant wife to the hospital in time for the birth of their daughter, despite a nasty traffic jam outside Abbey Road. But as his unusual life progresses, Tim finds out that his unique gift can't save him from the sorrows and ups and downs that affect all families, everywhere. There are great limits to what time travel can achieve, and it can be dangerous too.

***SHORT SUMMARY***
<p align="justify"> A high school boy finds the diary of his classmate‚Äïonly to discover that she‚Äôs dying. Sakura Yamauchi has been silently suffering from pancreatic disease, and now exactly one person outside her family knows. He swears to her that he won‚Äôt tell anyone what he learned, and the shared secret brings them closer together in this deeply moving, first-person story that traces their developing relationship in Sakura‚Äôs final months of life. The phrase 'I want to eat your pancreas' is meant to not only say that they want to keep a part of the other with them forever but is also a sign of complete acceptance. When Haruki tells Sakura that he would eat her infected pancreas, he is saying that he would consume the very best as well as the very worst of her. This is a story of love, pain, and loss. The anime is a piece of art that has the power to make spectators cry. I Want to Eat Your Pancreas' ending has been a hot topic among fans. It is indeed a sad story, but there are certain things to discuss, and the ending is one of them.
